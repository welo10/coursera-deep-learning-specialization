## [ðŸŽ“] Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
In the first course of the Deep Learning Specialization, you will study the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. get familliar with numpy, build your own neural network, build 2-layer deep neural network and build L-layer deep neural network all from scratch.
